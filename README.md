# AMC-UNIT-CELL-DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS
This project aims to investigate and develop a novel unit cell structure based on the Anisotropic Meta-materials (AMC) concept. The project proposes a comprehensive study of the AMC unit cell design, analysis, and optimization to achieve high performance in various applications, such as antenna systems, electromagnetic interference shielding, and energy absorption. The project involves simulations and experiments to evaluate the proposed AMC unit cell's electromagnetic properties, such as reflection coefficient and resonance frequency.  The results obtained will be used to optimize the AMC unit cell design parameters for specific applications. This project's outcome will provide an innovative solution to design and manufacture advanced electromagnetic and mechanical materials for antenna design, contributing to the advancement of material science and engineering.

# ANTENNA DESIGN 
As was already stated, the height of the substrate (FR4) in the proposed AMC design is 0.8mm. A 20mm edge defines the substrate's square shape. Radiation is administered through a ring-shaped square patch. This ring has an inner dimension of 16x16 mm and an outer dimension of 18x18 mm. The ring has a 2mm width. Here, a perfect E ground is applied to the complete structure.

Proposed AMC unit cell

Such 9-unit cells are arranged in a 3x3 matrix to form an AMC mat. Antennas can be placed over this sheet. This leads to an increase in the gain of the antenna.

# DESIGN OF UNIT CELL AND RESULTS
The unit cell of AMC was designed with a patch as shown in Fig:

The FR4 epoxy with a dielectric constant 4.4 has been selected as the substrate material. This substrate layer's thickness varied from 0.5 to 2 mm. According to Fig, it was discovered to have the most incredible bandwidth of 2.8 GHz at 0.8 mm. The resonance frequency of the unit cell is 4.7GHz as shown.

# PATCH ANTENNA WITH AMC SHEET AND RESULTS
To attain a better return loss value and gain values, the previously simulated antenna is placed above the AMC sheet. The dimensions and the other design parameters of the AMC sheet and the patch antenna remain the same as mentioned in the above section. For different distances between the Square Patch Antenna and the AMC sheet various Return Loss and Gain Values were obtained at the resonant frequency of 3.5GHz. The best results of the return loss and gain were obtained at the optimum distance of 7mm. The return loss and the gain of this antenna are found to be maximum at the resonant frequency of 3.5GHz. The return loss is calculated as -25dB from the S Parameter Plot. The gain is obtained as 5.12.

# CONCLUSION
  To conclude the project, the main aim was to design and analyze an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) unit cell that could operate within a bandwidth of 3.4 GHz. By utilizing electromagnetic simulation tools, such as HFSS, the unit cell's design parameters were optimized to achieve either high reflectivity or high transmittance within the desired bandwidth.
  The results of the AMC unit cell analysis demonstrated that this structure is an effective means of manipulating electromagnetic waves to achieve desired characteristics, such as high reflectivity or high transmittance. The optimized design parameters resulted in a unit cell that can operate within a bandwidth of 3.4 GHz, making it suitable for numerous communication and radar applications.
